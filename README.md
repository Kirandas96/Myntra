We don‚Äôt know each other before so, first each of us have been introduced, we decided to analyze the project, gathered the required tools and techniques to accomplish the task and knowing the ability of each team member. On second day we divided the entire project in the equal amount among all the team members, we also lost some of our files when we try to push on GitHub .Somehow we solved all issues and at last we managed to complete the project before the deadline.

This is the overall walkthrough of our project.......


Key Learning :-

From this construct week‚Äôs projects, we learned how effectively we can use the DOM to make our static page more responsive. Another thing is about Local Storage. Without the knowledge of local storage, we cant be able to do this much in this project.

Excited and wanna see our project‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
